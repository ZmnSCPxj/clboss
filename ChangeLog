- Fix incompatibility with C-Lightning 0.11.x by explicitly using "style": "tlv" instead of "legacy".
- Record offchain-to-onchain swaps, accessible via new `clboss-swaps` command.

0.11C
- Disable `ChannelComplainerByLowSuccessPerDay` for now.
- Adjust our judgment of "low onchain fee" downward (i.e. cheaper) slightly, from 25% +/-5% to 20% +/-3%.
- `ActiveProber` now only does a 2-hop probe always.
- `ChannelComplainerByLowSuccessPerDay` logs a little more on debug prints.
- Tweak parameters for auto-close slightly, being more lenient.
- Fix FreeBSD compile.

0.11B
- `ActiveProber` now also has a background cleaner of its payments.
- `ChannelCreationDecider` now holds off on creating channels if the onchain amount is small relative to all your funds and is small for a "large" channel (~0.16777215 BTC).  This should prevent CLBOSS from making lots of 10mBTC channels when your node is well-funded.
- CLBOSS can now close bad channels.  Enable this ***EXPERIMENTAL*** feature by passing `--clboss-auto-close=true` option to `lightningd`.  If enabled, the `clboss-unmanage` command can disable this for particular peers using the `close` key.
- Remove `libsodium` library, instead use SHA256 implementation from Bitcoin and our own code for basic securtiy issues.
- Add `clboss-unmanage` command to suppress certain aspects of auto-management.
- Fix `InitialRebalancer` bug (introduced in 0.11A) which completely disables it instead of throttling it.

0.11A
- Make `FundsMover` much less willing to pay extra for more private randomized routes.
- New `EarningsRebalancer` is now the primary rebalancer to replace the role of `InitialRebalancer` in previous releases; it will base its rebalancing decisions on earnings of each channel.
- `InitialRebalancer` will now limit how much it will spend on rebalances, as it is intended for the *initial* rebalancing of new channels.
- `FundsMover` is now more parsimonious about its fee budget when it splits moved funding attempts.
- Avoid making multiple channels to nodes with the same IP bin.
- Fix MacOS compile.
- Use `dig -v` to check for `dig` install, instead of `dig localhost`, as the latter may trigger a "real" lookup that will inevitably fail.

0.10 Made of Explodium
0.9A
- Avoid `DELETE ... ORDER BY`, which might not be enabled on the SQLITE3 available on some systems.
- Fix a roundoff error with command `id`s, which would lead to `clboss` eventually crashing after a few days or weeks.

0.8 Facepalm of Doom
0.7D
- Fix latent `printf`-formatting bugs in `SendpayResultMonitor`, which would crash on 32-bit systems.

0.7C
- `FundsMover` now deletes its failing payments immediately instead of letting them languish in your db until the cleanup process gets to them.

0.7B
- Ensure `InitialRebalancer` does not put the destination node at the edge of triggering `InitialRebalancer` again in the next cycle, which was causing multiple rebalances in sequence.
- New option `--clboss-min-onchain=<satoshi>` to indicate how much to leave onchain; defaults to 30000 satoshi, which is suggested to leave onchain in preparation for anchor commitments, but you can leave more (or less) now.
- Document `clboss-status` and `clboss-externpay` commands.
- New commands `clboss-ignore-onchain` and `clboss-notice-onchain` let you temporarily manage onchain funds manually.
- Change onchain fee judgment to use percentile based on the previous 2 weeks of feerates.
- Support MacOS compilation, also checked FreeBSD compilation still works.
- Correct calculation of spendable vs receivable in `NodeBalanceSwapper`.

0.7A
- Properly consider direction of flow when estimating capacities of nodes.
- Properly rebalance channels greater than 42.94mBTC payment limit.
- Use `payment_secret` in rebalances.
- Work around a timing bug in Tor SOCKS5 implementation.
- CLBOSS can now be started and stopped with the `lightningd` `plugin` command.
- Do not use `proxy` if `always-use-proxy` is not `true`.
- New `ChannelFinderByEarnedFee` module proposes peers of our most lucrative peers, to improve alternate routes to popular destinations.

0.6 Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!
0.5E
- Remove busy-wait loop in `FeeModderBySize`.

0.5D
- Tone down `FundsMover` payment cleanup.
- Batch up RPC socket response parsing.

0.5C
- `FundsMover` now has a backup process to clean up its payments.
- `ChannelFinderByListpays` now ignores self-payments instead of possibly proposing self.
- Optimize traversing JSON results for channel finders.
- Reduce processing load when printing really long RPC logs.
- Correctly handle sudden death of `lightningd` process.
- Really, do not delay response to `init`, for reals.

0.5B
- Do not delay response to `init`.

0.5A
- Handle `rpc_command` specially for better RPC response times even when CLBOSS is busy.
- Make compilable on FreeBSD.
- Print more debug logs for internet connection monitoring.
- Limit resources used by rebalancing attempts.
- Long-running processes (channel finders, peer fee competitor measuring) now print progress reports.
- Lowered execution priority of RPC socket reading and parsing, hopefully this will make us more responsive to our hooks.

0.4 Failed a Spot Check
0.3B
- `ChannelFinderByPopularity` now reduces its participation instead of not participating if we have many channels already.
- Channel finders now ensure they only run once even if multiple triggers occur while they are running.

0.3A
- Fixed missing initializations and some checks.
- Fixed build errors in Debian.
